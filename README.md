# MuJoCo IRB120 — 3D Center-of-Mass Estimation via Robotic Tipping

A physics-based framework for estimating the 3D center-of-mass (CoM) of unknown objects using an ABB IRB120 6-DOF manipulator. The robot pushes objects to the edge of a table, and a torque-balance model is fit to the observed tipping dynamics to recover object mass and CoM height. Both MuJoCo simulation and real-world experiments on a physical robot are supported.

## Overview

### Problem Statement

Estimating an object's center of mass from robot interactions is a fundamental capability for manipulation tasks such as grasping, transportation, and placement. This project addresses **CoM estimation without prior knowledge of object geometry**, using only the measured contact forces and object rotation during a controlled tipping maneuver.

### Approach

1. **Tipping Maneuver**: The robot pushes an object horizontally until it begins to tip over the table edge. A 6-axis force/torque sensor on the end-effector records contact forces throughout the motion.
2. **Orientation Tracking**: An AR tag on the object provides rotation angle θ via quaternion estimates (physical experiments), or the MuJoCo joint state is used directly (simulation).
3. **Torque-Balance Model**: At each timestep, the applied torque τ_app = r_f × F is matched against the gravity torque τ_grav = −r_c × R(−θ) · W using nonlinear least squares. The free parameters are mass m and CoM height z_c.
4. **Tipping Angle Prediction**: The estimated CoM is used to compute the critical tipping angle θ* = arctan(d_xy / z_c), which is the angle at which the object becomes unstable.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- MuJoCo (installed automatically via the `mujoco` Python package)
- Git (for submodule initialization)

### Installation

**1. Clone with submodules** (required for object assets):

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/<your-username>/mujoco_irb120.git
cd mujoco_irb120
```

If you already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, initialize the submodule manually:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**2. Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install mujoco numpy scipy matplotlib mediapy
```

**4. Install this repo as an editable package** (recommended for shared imports across scripts and notebooks):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

> **Note:** A `requirements.txt` is provided if available. You can also install directly:
> `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

### Analyze Experimental Data

Run the full analysis pipeline on the recorded CSV experiments:

```bash
python analyze_experiment.py
```

This will:
- Load experiment CSVs from `experiments/` for all test objects (box, heart, flashlight, monitor, soda)
- Apply a Butterworth + median + Savitzky-Golay filter cascade to the raw force signals
- Fit the torque-balance model to estimate mass *m* and CoM height *z_c*
- Compute tipping angle θ* and compare against ground-truth CAD values
- Save analysis plots to `figures/`

### Run the Simulation

Open the Jupyter notebook to simulate the robot performing the tipping maneuver:

```bash
cd scripts
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

The notebook covers:
- Loading an object into the MuJoCo scene
- Executing the robot push trajectory via damped-least-squares IK
- Recording force/torque, EE pose, and object angle data
- Running the CoM estimation pipeline on simulated data

### Test the IK Solver

```bash
cd scripts
python test_ik.py
```

Validates the damped-least-squares IK solver against known target poses and prints convergence statistics.

### Load Custom Objects

To generate a MuJoCo scene with a specific object:

```python
from load_obj_in_env import load_environment

model, data = load_environment(num=0)   # 0=box, 10=heart, 11=L-shape,
                                        # 12=monitor, 13=soda, 14=flashlight
```

## Technical Details

### Robot Model — ABB IRB120

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| DOF | 6 revolute joints |
| Payload | 3 kg |
| Reach | 580 mm |
| J1 range | ±165° |
| J2 range | ±110° |
| J3 range | ±70° |
| J4 range | ±160° |
| J5 range | ±120° |
| J6 range | ±400° |
| Force/torque sensor offset | 82.25 mm from flange |
| Pusher finger length | 110 mm |

Control gains: kp = 200 / kv = 100 (joints 1–3); kp = 100 / kv = 50 (joints 4–6)

### Inverse Kinematics

Three solvers are implemented in `robot_controller.py`:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Newton-Raphson | Standard Jacobian-based iteration |
| **Damped Least Squares** (default) | J^T (JJ^T + λ²I)^{-1} — robust near singularities |
| Gradient Descent | Step-based minimization of pose error |

The damping coefficient λ is adjusted dynamically based on the convergence rate to balance accuracy and singularity avoidance.

### CoM Estimation — Physics Model

The tipping maneuver produces a time series of contact force **F**(t) and object rotation angle θ(t). The model parameters m (mass) and z_c (CoM height) are recovered by minimizing:

```
min_{m, z_c}  ||τ_app(t) − τ_grav(θ(t), m, z_c)||²
```

where:
- **τ_app** = r_f × F — applied torque from finger contact
- **τ_grav** = −r_c × R(−θ) · W — gravity torque about the tipping edge
- **r_c** = [d_x, d_y, z_c]ᵀ — CoM position vector from pivot
- **R(−θ)** — rotation matrix for object angle about the tipping axis

Fitting is performed with `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` (Levenberg-Marquardt).

### Signal Processing

Raw force signals are passed through a three-stage filter cascade:

1. **Butterworth low-pass** — 4th order, 5 Hz cutoff (removes high-frequency vibration)
2. **Median filter** — kernel size 5 (removes impulse artifacts)
3. **Savitzky-Golay** — 3rd order polynomial, kernel size 89 (smooths while preserving tipping transient shape)
